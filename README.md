Making Wordle in Python 

I had a free minute this evening so I made Wordle in Python 
I wanted to focus on trying to incorporate dictionaries 

All code in this repository is original. Please reference me @marinarosenwald if your decide to use this code

To run: 
1) Clone respository
2) Open respository/folder in commandline
3) python[3] Main.py
4) Have fun!

To add: 
1) actual dictionary so the user can't just input anything
2) user interface
